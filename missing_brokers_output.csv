The different versions will be separated by a solid line with the reporting source labeled.  o 4.There are different statuses and dispositions for disclosure events:  oA disclosure event may have a status of pending, on appeal, orfinal. §A ""pending"" event involves allegations that have not been proven or formally adjudicated. §An event that is ""on appeal"" involves allegations that have been adjudicated but are currently being appealed. §A ""final"" event has been concluded and its resolution is not subject to change.  oA final event generally has a disposition of adjudicated, settled orotherwise resolved. §An ""adjudicated"" matter includes a disposition by (1) a court of law in a criminal or civil matter, or (2) an administrative panel in an action brought by a regulator that is contested by the party charged with some alleged wrongdoing. §A ""settled"" matter generally involves an agreement by the parties to resolve the matter. Please note that brokers and brokerage firms may choose to settle customer disputes or regulatory matters for business or other reasons. §A ""resolved"" matter usually involves no payment to the customer and no finding of wrongdoing on the part of the individual broker.

When more than one of these sources reports information for the same disclosure event, all versions of the event will appear in the BrokerCheck report. The different versions will be separated by a solid line with the reporting source labeled.  o 4.There are different statuses and dispositions for disclosure events:  oA disclosure event may have a status of pending, on appeal, orfinal. §A ""pending"" event involves allegations that have not been proven or formally adjudicated. §An event that is ""on appeal"" involves allegations that have been adjudicated but are currently being appealed. §A ""final"" event has been concluded and its resolution is not subject to change.  oA final event generally has a disposition of adjudicated, settled orotherwise resolved. §An ""adjudicated"" matter includes a disposition by (1) a court of law in a criminal or civil matter, or (2) an administrative panel in an action brought by a regulator that is contested by the party charged with some alleged wrongdoing. §A ""settled"" matter generally involves an agreement by the parties to resolve the matter. Please note that brokers and brokerage firms may choose to settle customer disputes or regulatory matters for business or other reasons. §A ""resolved"" matter usually involves no payment to the customer and no finding of wrongdoing on the part of the individual broker.

When more than one of these sources reports information for the same disclosure event, all versions of the event will appear in the BrokerCheck report. The different versions will be separated by a solid line with the reporting source labeled.  o 4.There are different statuses and dispositions for disclosure events:  oA disclosure event may have a status of pending, on appeal, orfinal. §A ""pending"" event involves allegations that have not been proven or formally adjudicated. §An event that is ""on appeal"" involves allegations that have been adjudicated but are currently being appealed. §A ""final"" event has been concluded and its resolution is not subject to change.  oA final event generally has a disposition of adjudicated, settled orotherwise resolved. §An ""adjudicated"" matter includes a disposition by (1) a court of law in a criminal or civil matter, or (2) an administrative panel in an action brought by a regulator that is contested by the party charged with some alleged wrongdoing. §A ""settled"" matter generally involves an agreement by the parties to resolve the matter. Please note that brokers and brokerage firms may choose to settle customer disputes or regulatory matters for business or other reasons. §A ""resolved"" matter usually involves no payment to the customer and no finding of wrongdoing on the part of the individual broker.
